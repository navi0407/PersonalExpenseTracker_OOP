# PersonalExpenseTracker_OOP
Personal Budget Tracker is a simple yet powerful desktop tool that helps users finally take control of where their money goes. It turns scattered income and expense notes into clear, organized records so users can see, in seconds, how much they earn, how much they spend, and what is left for savings or goals. By tracking every transaction and summarizing it in easy‑to-read reports, the system guides users to spot wasteful spending, adjust habits, and make smarter financial decisions with confidence.
